# Balloon Pop
Balloon Pop is a three-dimensional tribute to a popular two-dimensional game, Bloons Tower Defense. In this game, the player will operate in first-person and must aim and shoot darts at balloons that are flying in a fixed path throughout the world before they reach the end castle. These balloons come in waves, meaning that each wave will contain more numerous, faster, and durable balloons than the wave before. Each time the player pops a balloon, they are awarded money that they can use to spend on different power-ups for their darts: dart piercing, dart speed, dart throwing rate, and multi-dart shots. If the player cannot pop a balloon before it reaches the end in time, they will lose health points (and if they lose all health points they lose the game). If the player is able to successfully survive all waves, then they win the game.
